# Tweeby
An automated bot for twitter using Tweepy!
__ __


# About
> This bot will look for tweets that contain certain hashtags, if found. It'll send them a message/reply and like their tweet. Users also have an option to opt out of being replied to by mentioning the bot and saying "Opt-Out". You can also use the code/script to tweet from the account to be used.

This bot is (for me) being used to advertise my anti art theft project [Byte!](https://github.com/therealOri/byte). (Feel free to check it out).

# Note:
> Make sure to put your bot's @username (but without the "@") in the `tweets_blacklist.db` file so it doesn't respond to itself.
